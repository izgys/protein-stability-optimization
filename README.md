# 🧬 Protein Stability Optimization with AI + Molecular Dynamics

**Author:** [Your Name]  
**Project Type:** Computational Protein Design + Machine Learning + Molecular Simulation  
**Status:** 🚧 In Progress  
**Estimated Time:** ~5 weeks (1 hour/day)

---

## 📍 Project Overview

This project explores the use of **AI-based protein sequence design** tools, such as **ProteinMPNN** and **ThermoMPNN**, to generate stabilizing mutations in a well-characterized model protein. The stability of the wild-type and designed mutants is then evaluated using **Molecular Dynamics (MD)** simulations and structural analysis.

The entire workflow is built to be a practical, portfolio-worthy demonstration of integrating **machine learning**, **protein engineering**, and **physics-based simulation**.

## 🎯 Objectives

- ✅ Predict stabilizing mutations using **ProteinMPNN** or **ThermoMPNN**
- ✅ Predict wild-type and mutant 3D structures using **ColabFold**
- ✅ Simulate the wild-type and mutant protein structures using **OpenMM** or **GROMACS**
- ✅ Analyze simulation results (RMSD, hydrogen bonds, ΔΔG proxies)
- ✅ Evaluate and visualize structural stability differences
- ✅ Create a clean, reproducible, and documented project for your GitHub portfolio
